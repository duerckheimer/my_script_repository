# This is my Script Repository with my demo scripts which I used at SQLGrillen 2018. I changed them a little bit from the other sessions in case of variable-handling and some new feature/changes in AzureRM-Cmdlets.

Use them as they are - on your own risk and not in production (unless you checked them intensively) - I'm not responsible for problems in your environment.
