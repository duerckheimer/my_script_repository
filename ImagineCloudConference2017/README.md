# This is my Script Repository from Imagine Cloud Conference 2017, here you can find my demo scripts.

It is all about Azure SQL Databases and Automation via Powershell.
Scripts were written in an 'easy' way so that everyone might be able to understand.

The script base can be found on docs.microsoft.com and I just prepared them for a better presentation and demo tasks.

All scripts are provided "As-is" without any warrant/garantee and on your own risk.

If you have any question to my scripts don't hesitate to contact me: info@sql-aus-hamburg.de
